# Beans, Beans, Beans?

Beans cook faster and more evenly if they are soaked for 12 to 24 hours first.  To soak beans, you need only to cover them in a container and put them in the fridge.  Then drain and rinse them before you cook them.

The table below includes cooking times for pressure cookers, slow cookers, and stove top.  For the pressure cooker, "NPR" stands for "natural pressure release", which is when you remote the pressure cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to drop naturally.  "QR" stands for "Quick Release", which is when you release the pressure using the quick release valve.  This is *not* recommended for beans as it will cause them to split from the sudden pressure drop.

All yelds are calculated based on 1 cup of beans (covered with 2 cups of water).

# Day 3 — Stocking your pantry
Cooking is easier if you have all the ingredients on hand.  It is easy to be derailed if you are missing one or more ingredients.

## Benefits
- Shopping is easier — you only need to get a few fresh ingredients
- Always have food to fall back on, in case of ice storm, American invasion, or Zombie apocalypse. Or for those really busy weeks where you can’t get on shopping on your regular day.

## Basic Pantry List
Make sure that you have at least one item from each category:
- Oils (extra virgin olive, canola, sunflower, coconut)
- Condiments (Peanut butter, soy sauce, Sriracha, mustard)
- Grains (Brown rice, white rice, quinoa, pasta, millet, wheat berries)
- Legumes and Beans (Dried red, brown, and/or green lentils, canned chickpeas, canned black beans)
- Spices (Salt, pepper, curry powder, dried basil, oregano, sage, paprika, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon. You may want to expand this as you branch out into different cuisines)
- Aromatics (Onions, shallots, garlic, lemon and/or lime, ginger root)
- Shelf stable goods (Tomato sauce, crushed or diced tomatoes, silken tofu, coconut milk, soy milk, rice milk, etc)
- Other (flour, sugar, corn starch)

## Food storage
Most of the above pantry items do not need to be stored in the fridge.  Keep them in airtight containers, preferably in the dark.  If you don’t have a lot of pantry space, than consider re-using some jars or buying some mason jars and keep one or two portions in your kitchen, and the rest in a rubbermaid container in your closet or under your bed.

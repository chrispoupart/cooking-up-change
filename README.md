Cooking Up Change
=======

Cookbooks are a dime a dozen.  If you are like me, you might even collect them.  But a cookbook, by itself, is not very useful at teaching you how to cook, or helping you get into the habit of cooking regularly.

That is where this book comes in.  Designed to be digested in short exercises, we hope to give you the basic techniques you need to be comfortable in the kitchen.  Following the exercises on schedule will help you to turn these new skills into a regular habit.  Soon, you will be wondering why you never spent more time in your kitchen.

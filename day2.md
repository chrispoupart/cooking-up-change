# Day 2 â€” Moving Mountains, One Rock At A Time

## What steps are required to cook?

## TODO: Provide a template to map out new small habits on a worksheet, then encourage people to follow it every day this week.

Habit building follows this path:
1. Task (Super basic.  So easy that someone can do it after working a 30 hour shift)
2. Trigger (When should they be doing it?)
3. Confirmation that it will be done every day/night
4. Personal reward for accomplishing it.  Yay gameification
5. What can be the next step that builds on this one?
